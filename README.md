# cryptochat

The app is fully packaged, so as long as you have xCode, you should just be able to download it, and open the *workspace*, and then you can run in it the top left corner with the play button, changing the device for a 2nd run if you want to have multiple simulators going at the same time to simulate the chat aspect. All the code I wrote is in the CryptoChat folder, with most of the crypto-related code in the Registration file, ChatsTableViewController file, and CreateChat file.
